# Classical ciphers laboratory

#### Author: George Vragalev

## Theory
Cryptography is a branch of mathematics that deals with securing information, also ensuring authentication and restricting access in an informational system.

Classic cryptography falls under the class of symmetric key cryptography and is cryptography 
before the computer, hence the name pre-computational cryptography. In classic cryptography, 
algorithms were character-based and consisted of a series of elementary transformations 
(substitutions and transpositions) of plaintext characters.

#### Substitution ciphers

#### Monoalphabetic substitution ciphers

### The Caesar Cipher

### Transposition cipher

## Objectives

* Get familiar with the basics of cryptography and classical ciphers.

* Implement 4 types of the classical ciphers:
Caesar cipher,
Transposition cipher,
Vigenere cipher,
Playfair cipher.
* Structure the project in methods/classes/packages as neeeded.


## Implementation

In this laboratory I implemented 4 variations of classical ciphers:

* Caesar cipher
* Vigenere cipher
* Playfair cipher
* Transposition cipher.

This is a console application that allows you to test all these various ciphers until you want to 
quit the app. 

When you run you will be provided with 5 options:

4 of them will be the choice of cipher and the 5th option would be to quit the program.

In each of the ciphers you will be provided the choice of whether you want to quit or if you want to
encrypt a new message at the end of each cipher execution.
